this is my first swing project. i used miglayout and flatlaf to make the program look good. its a classic wordle game, you have 6 tries to guess the random word.
<p>letter color meanings:
<p>green: the letter is at the correct place.
<p>orange: word contains that letter, but it's in the wrong place.
<p>gray: word doesn't contain that letter.

<p>NOTE: the language is turkish by default, it can be changed by replacing "turkish.txt" in the main class with "english.txt". i was planning to create this project only for turkish, so i used turkish localization while listening the keyboard to avoid non-turkish letters. i felt too lazy to change the code for the english version, so you can't actually type letters like w,x,q.
